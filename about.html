            Jeremie comes from a scientific background, after studying a masters degree in engineering and acoustics, Jeremie moved to Bristol to work as acoustic engineer. The pressures of work and demands of daily life motivated him to look at ways to manage my stress levels. He came across meditation in 2011 and did an 8 weeks MBSR course in 2012. As well as helping with stress levels, mindfulness brought a deeper sense of meaning to his life. A few years later he decided to leave his engineering job to follow a path more aligned with his own values. In late 2016 enrolled on the teacher pathway with Bangor University and will soon be a fully accredited mindfulness teacher.
