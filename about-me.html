            Jeremie comes from a scientific background, after studying a masters degree in engineering and acoustics, Jeremie moved to Bristol to work as acoustic engineer. The pressures of work and demands of daily life motivated him to look at ways to manage my stress levels. He came across meditation in 2011 and did an 8 weeks MBSR course in 2012. As well as helping with stress levels, mindfulness brought a deeper sense of meaning to his life. A few years later he decided to leave his engineering job to follow a path more aligned with his own values. In late 2016 enrolled on the teacher pathway with Bangor University and will soon be a fully accredited mindfulness teacher.
          </p>

Jeremie is exited to start his own course for the first time in March 2018. As a new teacher, I he offer very low rate courses.

            Jeremie follows the Good Practice Guidelines laid out by the UK Network for Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations. He has an accredited supervisor who supports and advises him. As well as maintaining a daily meditation practice Jeremie really enjoys  attending silent meditation retreats ranging from one day group retreats to  6-week personal work retreats.
